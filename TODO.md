1. **Run the ADAS System**
   - Execute the `adas.py` script to start the ADAS system.
   - Ensure that the camera or video source is correctly set up.

2. **Test Object Detection**
   - Verify that the system correctly detects various objects (cars, trucks, motorcycles, stop signs, traffic lights, and pedestrians).
   - Check that the alerts are triggered appropriately based on the proximity of detected objects.

3. **Check Risk Assessment**
   - Ensure that the risk assessment system works as intended, providing correct alerts for different object types based on their area ratio and proximity.

4. **Monitor Console Output**
   - Observe the console for any error messages or warnings during execution.
   - Ensure that the logging functionality is capturing relevant information.

5. **Test User Controls**
   - Test the user controls for pausing, resuming, and toggling lane detection.
   - Verify that the help menu displays correctly.

6. **Finalize Testing**
   - Document any issues encountered during testing and address them as necessary.
   - Confirm that the system is functioning as expected before final deployment.
